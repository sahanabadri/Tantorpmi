						<p class="center-text large-text">Welcome back, <em>Keewatin</em>: Last Great Lakes steamship comes home</p>
						<div class="example example-solid">
						<p class=""><strong>Paragraph (1):</strong> Skyline International Development announced in October 2011 that it was purchasing the 106-metre-long steamship S.S. <em>Keewatin</em> and returning her to Port McNicoll, in the Ontario township of Tay. The vessel, which had been docked in Saugatuck, Michigan, since 1967, was once the crown jewel of the mighty Great Lakes fleet of steamships operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway.</p>
						<p class=""><strong>Paragraph (2):</strong> The Scottish-built S.S. <em>Keewatin</em> was launched on July 6, 1907. It could carry 288 passengers and a crew of 86, and cruised at a top speed of 14 knots (nautical miles per hour). The steamship and its sister ship S.S. <em>Assiniboia</em> were the first Great Lakes vessels equipped with radar.</p>
						<p class=""><strong>Paragraph (3):</strong> For almost 60 years, the <em>Keewatin</em> ferried passengers between Port McNicoll, on Georgian Bay, and Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay) on Lake Superior. They travelled in style: stately features included a grand staircase, an elegant Edwardian-era dining saloon, hand-painted Italian glass and oak trim throughout. However, strict fire codes and faster alternatives made the wood-cabined vessels obsolete by the mid-1960s.</p>
						<p class="right"><strong>Paragraph (4):</strong> Since retirement in 1966, the <em>Keewatin</em> has served as a maritime museum. After being restored to its early 20th-century grandeur, it will continue operating as a museum from a new mooring for many years to come. The adjacent waterfront park, with a replica of Port McNicoll's original train station and its English-style gardens, is an additional attraction.</p>
						<p class="right"><strong>Paragraph (5):</strong> "We are thrilled to return the world's last Edwardian passenger steamship to the people of Tay Township and Canada," said Gil Blutrich, Skyline's chairman and president.</p>

							Although the Marshmallow Test was an experiment designed to test self-control in four-<br>
							year-old nursery school pupils, it has become one possible indicator of future success. At<br>
							Stanford University in the 1960s, researchers told children they could have one thing they<br>
							really wanted right away—a marshmallow or a candy, for example—but if they could wait<br>
							15 minutes, they could have two. The researchers, led by psychologist Walter Mischel, <strong>(line 5)</strong><br>
							found only about 30 per cent of more than 600 children tested could hold out. When<br>
							Mischel followed up in the 1980s, he discovered that those who had been able to wait for<br>
							two marshmallows averaged more than 10 percent higher on college entrance exams than<br>
							did those who could wait only 30 seconds. The Marshmallow Test predicted success more<br>
							accurately than how well the children were able to read or do math. Their success can <strong>(line 10)</strong><br>
							be attributed to their ability to control impulses, sustain attention, and plan and develop<br>
							strategies to achieve goals. Collectively, these brain skills are known as "executive function"<br>
							or "self-regulation." York University professor Stuart Shanker says students can learn the<br>
							ability to self-regulate. Improving executive function skills involves learning how one's own<br>
							brain works, identifying goals and motivations and learning strategies to accomplish those <strong>(line 15)</strong><br>
							goals. Shanker stresses that learning executive function skills is not the same as learning to<br>
							comply with orders. Exercising self-regulation comes from within. It is self-directed and it<br>
							appears to be a key skill in helping kids achieve success.
